<p style="text-align:center;""font-size:30px;">For this project, I wanted to see how these different programs would affect these 
masterwork pieces by Claude Monet, who is most well-known form is oil impressionist paintings. Oil painting was the first medium 
that I ever fell in love with, so seeing it being distorted using audio programs was an exciting experience.</p>
