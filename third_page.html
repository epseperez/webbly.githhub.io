<h1 style="font-size:60px;text-align:center;">Memories</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;""font-size:30px;">This artwork is inspired by my grandfather, being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
 It was a turbulent time for my family, and seeing the effects first had was devastating, so I wanted to capture these felings
 in my work. I made the painting more in the form of memory and hazy, 
showing a more dream or fading image of the grandfather slowly diapering. </p>
