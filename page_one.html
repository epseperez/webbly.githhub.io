<p style="font-size:30px;color:white;"text-align:center;color:white;">As someone who is interested in Wiccan and folklore magic,
 I like to imagine what religious figures would look 
 like if the older religions had stayed in power instead of Christianity. 
 I then referenced artworks of Nunes and reimagined them as priestesses instead, making
 sure to include images of specific plants like sage and symbols on the robes.</p>
