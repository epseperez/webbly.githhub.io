<h1 style="font-size:60px;text-align:center;">Choices</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;""font-size:30px;">For this assignment, I was thinking about making a website, but because of my love of video games,
 I played around whit making a chose your-own adventure game! I would definitely like to develop this 
 by making more choices and different endings, but it would definitely be a project that I would work
 on in my free time. Hope you enjoy!.</p>
